        <h1>Long Story Short</h1>

     <article class="the-what">
        <h1>The What</h1>
      <p><em>Open Mic Tech is a quarterly community-driven event designed to facilitate communication among professionals, students, and hobbyists in tech-related fields.</em> </p>

      <p> That's just a fancy way to say that Open Mic Tech is a place for us to come together and talk about the stuff we're doing. Just as the name suggests, it's an open mic night geared toward technology.</p>
      <p>What types of technology? All of them! However you use tech to do the things you do, we want to hear about it! </p>
      <p>Are you a photographer who has a trick to speed up photo editing?</p> 
      <p>Are you a developer who has fallen in love with a little-known programming language?</p> 
      <p>Are you a writer who uses a new tool for organizing your literature?</p>
      <p>Want to put "public speaker" in your Twitter bio? </p>
      <p>If you answered yes, consider coming out one night and giving a quick (5-15 minutes) talk about that thing you like.</p>
