# About Open Mic Tech
## Long Story Short
Open Mic Tech is just as it sounds: an open mic night for tech stuff.

## The What
Open Mic Tech is a quarterly community-driven event designed to facilitate communication in among professionals and hobbyists in tech-related fields.

That's just a fancy way to say that Open Mic Tech is a place for us to come together and talk about the stuff we're doing. Just as the name suggests, it's an open mic night geared toward technology.

What types of technology? All of them! However you use tech to do the things you do, we want to hear about it! 

Are you a photographer who has a trick to speed up photo editing? Are you a developer who has fallen in love with a little-known programming language? Are you a writer who uses a new tool for organizing your literature? Want to put "public speaker" in your Twitter bio?

If you answered yes, consider coming out one night and giving a quick (5-15 minutes) talk about that thing you like.

## The Why
The greater Baton Rouge area is filled with smart, talented and wildly interesting people who can teach each other a thing or two. OMT is here to help that happen.

By providing an open, and easy atmosphere for people to share ideas, OMT hopes to increase cross-industry collaboration for newbies and veterans alike.

So whether you're new to a given field or have decades under your belt, OMT wants to be a place where you can learn something new.

## The Who
Who speaks at Open Mic Tech? You! If you want to, that is. The whole idea of this OMT to provide a free space for us to share our ideas.

## The When
Open Mic Tech happens the second Tuesday of every quarter from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.
